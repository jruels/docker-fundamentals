# LAB
## Docker Images Part 2

*Lab Objectives*

This lab demonstrates how to build and run WordPress All-In-One using a Dockerfile.

Lab Structure - Overview
1.	Use a Dockerfile to build and run WordPress All-In-One image
 

### 1. Build and Run WordPress All-In-One
1.	In the command line, create and navigate to a folder that will be used to store the files for this lab. For example:  
    `mkdir wp-aio-cli`  
    `cd ~/wp-aio-cli`

2.	Using the in-line text editor vim, create the contents of the Dockerfile provided in this lab:  
    `vim Dockerfile`  
You can switch to Insert Text mode with the 'i' command. Edit the file contents to look like the snippet below.  
*Note:  if you construct the file with cut&paste (not recommended), work on one line at a time to avoid artifacts.* 

```dockerfile
    FROM shaunassam/wpaio-ubuntu1804
    LABEL activity="wp-cli-install"

    RUN apt-get update &&\
        apt-get install wget
    RUN wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
    RUN mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wp
```

3.	To exit and save the Dockerfile, hit the esc button and enter  
    `:wq`

4.	Build a new image using the Dockerfile:  
    `docker build -t wordpress-cli:aio-dockerfile .`  
*NOTE: you must add the period at the end*  
The output will list each step from the Dockerfile as it completes and give an image ID when the build is successful.
    ```
    Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.048 kB
    Step 1 : FROM lindison/wordpress-aio
    ---> 2740960e64da
    Step 2 : LABEL activity "wp-cli-install"
    ---> Using cache
    ---> 2d73ad8d6742
    Step 3 : RUN apt-get update &&    apt-get install wget
    ---> Using cache
    ---> 56d349b38274
    Step 4 : RUN wget wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
    ---> Using cache
    ---> dbb6c6231ea9
    Step 5 : RUN mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wp
    ---> Using cache
    ---> 51a742a8a163
    Successfully built 51a742a8a163
    Successfully tagged wordpress-cli:aio-dockerfile
    ```

5.	The following command will list the images currently on the machine. The new image wordpress-cli:aio-dockerfile  should be listed among them.  
    `docker images`

6.	Deploy a container using the image that was created from the image buildâ€™s context defined in the Dockerfile (wordpress-cli:aio-dockerfile).  
    `docker run -d -P wordpress-cli:aio-dockerfile`

7.	Enter  
    `docker port $(docker ps -lq)`  
    Two ports will be listed:  
    ```
    3306/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32779  
    80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32780  
    ```

8.	In a web browser, navigate to http://`<IP_Address>`:port using the local host IP address of your machine and the port mapped to 80/tcp from the previous step (i.e. 32780).

9.	Configure WordPress with the following credentials:

    `Username: root`  
    `Password: root`

10.	Test the install again with the following execute command:  
`docker exec $(docker ps -lq) wp theme list --allow-root --path='/var/www/html'`  
The output will look like this:
    ```
    name	            status	update	version
    twentyeleven	inactive	available	2.3
    twentyfifteen	active	available	1.4
    twentyfourteen	inactive	available	1.6
    twentyten	inactive	none	2.1
    twentythirteen	inactive	available	1.8
    twentytwelve	inactive	available	1.9
    ```

11. Run a history of the wordpress-cli:aio-dockerfile image:  
`docker history wordpress-cli:aio-dockerfile`

12.	Run a history of the wordpress-cli:aio-manual image:  
`docker history <dockerhubusername>/wordpress-cli:aio-manual`

13. Run a diff on the container made from the wordpress-cli:aio-dockerfile image:  
`docker diff <container ID>`

14.	Run a diff on the container made from the wordpress-cli:aio-manual image. Note the different A (Adds), C (Changes), and D (Deletes). Which changes did you make in the previous manual build lab? Which changes appear to be made by WordPress running?   
`docker diff <container ID>`

15.	Finally, use docker rm command to remove the containers from this lab and clean up the environment. For more information, enter  
`docker --help`

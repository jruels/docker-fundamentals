## Docker Images Part 1
*Lab Objectives*

This lab demonstrates how to search through the repositories located on Docker Hub using the web browser as well as the Command Line Interface. This lab then walks through the steps to deploy WordPress All-In-One and add the WordPress CLI.

Lab Structure - Overview
1.	Search Docker Hub for Images
2.	Deploy WordPress All-In-One
3.	Add WordPress CLI

 
### 1. Search Docker Hub for Images
Step by Step Guide
1.	In a web browser, navigate to http://hub.docker.com and log in to Docker Hub. Creating a Docker Hub account is free and simple if you do not have one already.

2.	Once logged in to Docker Hub, use the Search bar at the top to locate the official WordPress image.

3.	Select the wordpress image with the official tag below it.

4.	Here you can see all the information about this repository. Next, click on the Tags tab.

5.	This tab shows a list of all the images that have been tagged in this repository.

6.	Search for nginx and select one of the repositories to see more details.

7.	Look on the page for a link to the repo. Open this and review the Dockerfile.

8.	This is where the information about the base image and repository maintainer is located, as well as the build code.

9.	You can also search for an image using the CLI. From a command line running Docker, enter 
docker search wordpress. This will list all of the repositories within Docker Hub without having to go through the web browser.

### 2. Deploy WordPress All-In-One and the WordPress CLI
Step by Step Guide
1.	In the command line, enter the following command to deploy the WordPress All-In-One container. In the following steps, this WordPress all-in-one will receive a WordPress tool called the "WordPress CLI." This tools allows WordPress administrators to interact with their WordPress deployment using the command-line.  
    `docker run -d -P --name wpaio shaunassam/wpaio-ubuntu1804`  
The last line of output will be a container ID.  

2.	Run the following command to validate that WordPress CLI is not installed.  
    `docker exec wpaio wp theme list --allow-root --path='/var/www/html'`  
The output will contain an error message. This is because the WordPress CLI is not yet installed.  
    ```
    OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: container_linux.go:348: starting container process caused "exec: \"wp\": executable file not found in $PATH": unknown
    ```

3.	Run the docker port command to get the mapped ports of the WordPress all-in-one container.  
    `docker port wpaio `  
Two ports will be listed as the output:  
    ```
    3306/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32769  
    80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32770  
    ```

4.	In a web browser, navigate to http://`<IP_Address>`:port using the local host IP address of your machine and the port mapped to 80/tcp from the previous step (i.e. 32770).

7.	Configure WordPress with the following credentials:  
    `Username: root`  
    `Password: root`  
    *You will get a warning about a weak password, you would never use a root user and password in anything production but it will work for this short class*

8.	Use the docker exec command to gain remote access to the WordPress container and run some configuration commands.  
    `docker exec -it wpaio /bin/bash`

9.	Once inside the WordPress container, enter the following commands in following sequence to install the WordPress CLI tool.  
    ```sh
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y wget
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
    mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wp
    cd /var/www/html
    wp theme list --allow-root
    ```
The command line will return the following output and validate that the WordPress CLI has been installed on the running container.  
    ```
    No value for $TERM and no -T specified   
    
    +----------------+----------+-----------+---------+
    | name           | status   | update    | version |
    +----------------+----------+-----------+---------+
    | twentyeleven   | inactive | available | 2.3     |
    | twentyfifteen  | active   | available | 1.4     |
    | twentyfourteen | inactive | available | 1.6     |
    | twentyten      | inactive | none      | 2.1     |
    | twentythirteen | inactive | available | 1.8     |
    | twentytwelve   | inactive | available | 1.9     |
    +----------------+----------+-----------+---------+
    ```

10.	Now exit the WordPress container:  
    `exit`

â€ƒ
### 1. Test the WordPress CLI Install
Step by Step Guide
1.	Run the command from the earlier step and validate that the WordPress CLI is executable using the docker exec command.  
    `docker exec wpaio wp theme list --allow-root --path='/var/www/html'`  
If it is working correctly, it will output this:  
    ```
    name            status      update      version
    twentyeleven    inactive    available   2.3
    twentyfifteen   active      available	1.4
    twentyfourteen	inactive	available	1.6
    twentyten       inactive	none        2.1
    twentythirteen	inactive	available	1.8
    twentytwelve	inactive	available	1.9
    ```

2.	Now commit the WordPress CLI container to an image. This will commit the read/write layer of the running container to an image in the local image cache.  
    `docker commit -m "added wpcli" wpaio <dockerhubusername>/wordpress-cli:aio-manual`  
The output will be a new image ID.

3. 	Log in to your account on Docker Hub, so that you can access the registry:  
    `docker login`  
You will need to enter the username and password you used when you created your account, as follows:  
    `docker login`  
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) to create one.  
    `Username: <dockerhubusername>`  
    `Password: *****`  
Login Succeeded

4.	Using the new image created in the previous step, enter  
    `docker push <dockerhubusername>/wordpress-cli:aio-manual`

5.	Deploy a container from the newly created image, this container will create a read/write layer above the previous layer which carries the installed WordPress CLI.  
    `docker run -d -P --name wpaio2 <dockerhubusername>/wordpress-cli:aio-manual  `

6.	Run the following to get the dynamic port mapping of the newly deployed container.   
    `docker port wpaio2`  
Two ports will be listed:  
3306/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32769  
80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32770

7.	In a web browser, navigate to http://`<IP_Address>`:port using the local host IP address of your machine and the port mapped to 80/tcp from the previous step (i.e. 32770).

8.	Configure WordPress again with the same credentials as before:  
    `Username: root`  
    `Password: root`  

9.	Test the install again with the same execute command as before:  
    `docker exec wpaio2 wp theme list --allow-root --path='/var/www/html'`  
The output should remain the same:  
    ```
    name            status	    update	    version
    twentyeleven	inactive	available	2.3
    twentyfifteen	active      available	1.4
    twentyfourteen	inactive	available	1.6
    twentyten	    inactive	none      	2.1
    twentythirteen	inactive	available	1.8
    twentytwelve	inactive	available	1.9
    ```
This validates that the WordPress CLI is already installed on the image. The image wordpress-cli:aio-manual was created from the read/write layer of the previous container wpaio; which, had the WordPress CLI installed on it. 

10.	Return to view your Docker Hub account in a web browser. Find the repository for the image you pushed, and view the information you can now edit. What statistics is Docker Hub reporting for the repository?
